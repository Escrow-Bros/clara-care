## Insights

1. **Vocabulary & coherence**  
   Strong on good days (e.g. 0.64–0.68 TTR, 0.88–0.91 coherence). Drops on 2026-02-06 and 2026-02-07 (TTR 0.50–0.52, coherence 0.72–0.75), matching confused/distressed mood and a **high** vocabulary_decline alert.

2. **Word-finding**  
   Word-finding pauses spike on 2026-02-06 (5) and 2026-02-07 (6), with two word_finding_difficulty alerts (one acknowledged).

3. **Nostalgia engagement**  
   Nostalgia mode used three times (1966–1976 era); engagement scores 8–10. Dorothy responds well to 1960s music and gardening memories.

4. **Mood**  
   Mix of happy, nostalgic, neutral, sad, confused, and distressed. Recent good days (2026-02-08–09) show recovery after the difficult 2026-02-06–07 period.

5. **Recommendation**  
   The **high** vocabulary_decline alert and dips in vocabulary/coherence and word-finding suggest a 30-day PDF report and, if not already done, a brief clinical follow-up to review trend and consider cognitive assessment.
